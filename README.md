Make sure you put the CSV file called "14a149a8-1486-4f1d-9cb9-a9fc3f3cfea7.csv" into a folder at C:\UserFiles\

The groundwork for this implies a file handling system where the GUID can be included in the API URL, however this is not yet implemented.

See the Repositories, Models, and Services folders for specific implementations related to this project.
